Without caching, repeatedly downloading assets can consume significant resources and cause delays in loading times. To overcome this, developers use a variety of caching strategies, including &lt;strong>disk caching&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>LRU (Least Recently Used) caching&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>database caching&lt;/strong>, and others, to enhance performance and minimize latency.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the &lt;strong>Beeda User&lt;/strong> app, effectively handling media assets like images, Lottie animations, and videos was essential for ensuring a fast and seamless user experience. Each type of media asset comes with its own specific needs and challenges when it comes to caching and optimization:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improving Beeda's Swift Compilation times by 83%</title><link>https://chowdhurynawaf.github.io/en/posts/improving-beedas-swift-compilation-time/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 08:01:47 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://chowdhurynawaf.github.io/en/posts/improving-beedas-swift-compilation-time/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="context">Context&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As Beeda expanded with new features, compile times began to pose a serious challenge. A simple change or full compilation took around 11 minutes, slowing down our workflow significantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enhance productivity and streamline development, we aimed to drastically reduce this compile time. In this article, Iâ€™ll walk you through how we successfully brought it down to just 2 minutes.&lt;/p>
